Add the CPU temperature to Victron Venus OS (if running on Raspberry PI).

Setup:
RpiTemperature requires that SetupHelper is installed first.

The easiest way to install RpiTemperature is to do a "blind install" of SetupHelper and then add the RpiTemperature package
via the PackageManager menus.

Refer to SetupHelper here:
