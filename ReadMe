Add the CPU temperature to Victron Venus OS (if running on Raspberry PI).

It is possible to set a custom name for the raspberry pi temperature. It is also possible to define the type of temperature sensor (battery, freezer, other). 
I would recommend to use type other.

Setup:
RpiTemperature requires that SetupHelper is installed first.

The easiest way to install RpiTemperature is to do a "blind install" of SetupHelper and then add the RpiTemperature package
via the PackageManager menus.

Refer to SetupHelper here:
